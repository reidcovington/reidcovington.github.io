Technological innovation continues to accelerate at previously considered unsustainable levels. Yet, <span class='tooltip' title='polarized.jpg'>the American people haven’t been this polarized since the Civil War</span>(<a href="http://io9.com/its-been-150-years-since-the-u-s-was-this-politically-1590076355">article</a>). The education system, secondary especially, but primary as well, is failing us (<a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139113/jal-mehta/why-american-education-fails">article</a>). Sociological and cultural epidemics run rampant. We’re drowning (not like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbB3z2fZ7PM&feature=kp">Avicii song</a>).

Listen, please don’t take this the wrong way. I am merely setting the table for what I believe is an unprecedented opportunity to make massive, meaningful changes. And I believe <span class='tooltip' title='techweapon.jpg'>technology is the weapon that we will use to do that</span>.

And as I am just a dreamer who loves to build and grow meaningful full-stack web applications, co-founder and head of development at <a href='http://www.shopcube.com'>ShopCube.com</a>, co-creator of <a href='http://www.smartipantsgame.com'>SmartiPants</a>, I, Reid Covington, hope to be a part of this change. There is nothing I find more exhilarating than taking a project from inception to launch to profitability. I delight in wire-framing, analyzing UX, finding ways to improve and optimize, and using data to launch carefully curated marketing campaigns.

Not every post on this blog is going to change the world (or even your opinion). But as they say, <span class='tooltip' title='predict.jpg'>the best way to predict the future is to invent it</span>. I hope I can share little pieces of the bricks that do change the world with you. And brick by brick we will start to build something that we can begin to be proud of. So I thank you in advance for your patience and support for me and for everyone who strives to predict a better future.

Please feel free to check out <a href='/jekyll/update/2014/07/01/who-is-the-real-cat-man/'>this post</a> for a little more background on how I got here and please please reach out to me at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> as we take this journey together.
